                <h3>1. Lesser Known Routes of Ladakh - Wari La Pass</h3>
                <p>Ladakh, the land of the Lamas, is in itself quite offbeat. While tourism here has picked up, especially 
                    for us wanderer folks – there’s still a bunch of information available on a lot of the places. Ladakh is a very secluded place that is often on the list of true nature loves and explorers. However, there is still so much beauty that is untouched in this Himalayan wonderland, with each spot as exquisite and breathtaking as the next.

                <h3>2. Hanle Village – an offbeat place in Ladakh</h3>
                <p>LHanle is also situated in the Changthang region and has to most soul-satisfying vibes. Home to around 300 people, Hanle is home to a beautiful monastery, housing about 10 monks. And, the views from the top will stop you in your tracks. It is situated only 19 Kms from the disputed frontier of the Line of Actual Control. It is also home to the Indian Astronomical Observatory. The location of both the village and the observatory are highly sensitive due to the close proximity of the Tibetan / Chinese border and special permission are needed to visit either by the government of India.

                <h3>3. Basgo Plains near Nimmu – Sham Valley</h3>
                <p>Situated around 60 km from Leh in the Sham Valley region of Ladakh, Uleytokpo is a camping area based on the banks of the Indus River. This makes for an idyllic place to call home for your trip – if you are absolutely keen on avoiding the “city” life and don’t want to interact with humans. If nature is what piques your interest and you need a base for your journeys – then look no further, dear friend!
